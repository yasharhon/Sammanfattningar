\section{Basic Concepts}

\paragraph{A Note on Minkowski Space}
In special relativity we work with Minkowski space, which is an affine space with a so-called pseudo-metric. This is a metric which is not positive definite, but instead a metric which has only non-zero eigenvalues (and is thus termed non-degenerate). We will work with the signature $(1, 3)$, meaning that there are three eigenvalues of $-1$ and one eigenvalue $1$.

\paragraph{The Description of Spacetime}
In general relativity we will describe spacetime as a $4$-dimensional manifold with a pseudometric of signature $(1, 3)$ with a Levi-Civita connection imposed on it.

\paragraph{Kinematics of Test Particles}
A test particle is a particle that itself does not affect the spacetime. Such particles can generally move through spacetime, along curves called world lines. With this motion comes the $4$-velocity $V$, defined as the normalized tangent to a world line. In special relativity we could also define a proper acceleration by differentiating with respect to proper time. In general relativity we replace this with the $4$-acceleration $A = \dcov{V}{V} = \dcov{\dot{\gamma}}{\dot{\gamma}}$.  We may also define the proper acceleration $\alpha$, which satisfies $\alpha^{2} = -A^{2} = -g(A, A)$, and it can be shown that if $V$ is time-like, then $A$ is space-like. Note that the curve parameter we use is $\tau$, which is the proper time and a measure of length in spacetime.

\paragraph{Free Particles}
A free particle in special relativity is a particle for which $A = 0$. We take this definition to apply in general relativity as well. This implies that free test particles travel along spacetime geodesics.

\paragraph{$4$-Momentum and $4$-Force}
We also define the $4$-momentum $P = mV$ and the $4$-force $F = \dcov{V}{P}$.

\paragraph{Frequency Shift}
A wave generally has a phase which depends on both position and time. We define the frequency of a wave as $\omega = \dv{\phi}{t}$. For a general world line we define
\begin{align*}
	\omega = \dv{\phi}{\tau} = \dot{\chi}^{a}\del{a}{\phi} = V\phi = \df{\phi}(V).
\end{align*}
$\df{\phi}$ is the dual of the $4$-frequency $N^{\mu}$. It can be shown that $\dcov{N}{\df{\pi}} = 0$, and thus $\dcov{N}{N} = 0$. Rays with tangent $N$ are thus light-like geodesics.

In general an observer will measure a frequency $\df{\phi}(V)$.

\paragraph{Simultaneity}
Two events are simultaneous if they are on the same hypersurface of constant $t$. As this depends very much on the choice of coordinates on spacetime, this notion is not at all well-defined.

\paragraph{Static and Stationary Spacetime}
If there exists a stime-like Killing field of a spacetime, it is stationary. If the spacetime is also orthogonal to a family of $3$-surfaces, the spacetime is static. The consequences of the latter is that the metric has no off-diagonal components.

\paragraph{The Schwarzschild Solution}
The Schwarzschild solution is the simplest solution for a spherically symmetric metric. It is of the form
\begin{align*}
	\dd{s}^{2} = \left(1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}\right)\dd{t}^{2} - \left(1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}\right)^{-1}\dd{r}^{2} - r^{2}\dd{\Omega}^{2},
\end{align*}
where $R_{\text{S}}$ is the Schwarzschild radius and we work in units where $c = 1$. To reobtain Newtonian gravity at large distances we would need $R_{\text{S}} = 2MG$.

This metric has singularities at $r = R_{\text{S}}$ and $r = 0$. If you study the curvature invariant $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}$, however, you find that it is finite at $r = R_{\text{S}}$ and diverges at $r = 0$. This would imply that there exists a smart choice of coordinates in which the singularity at $R_{\text{S}}$ would be eliminated.

This set of coordinates, called Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, replaces $t$ with a coordinate that has the light-like geodesics as coordinate lines. For a purely radial path the requirement $\dd{s}^{2} = 0$ for such a geodesic yields
\begin{align*}
	\dd{t}^{2} = \left(1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}\right)^{-2}\dd{r}^{2},
\end{align*}
with solution
\begin{align*}
	t = u - r - R_{\text{S}}\ln(\frac{r}{R_{\text{S}}} - 1),
\end{align*}
where $u$ is an integration constant labelling the geodesics. This will be the new coordinate. In these coordinates we obtain
\begin{align*}
	\dd{s}^{2} = \left(1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}\right)\dd{u}^{2} - 2\dd{u}\dd{r} - r^{2}\dd{\Omega}^{2}.
\end{align*}
Notably, there is now only a singularity at $r = 0$.

For radial light cones in these coordinates, one obtains
\begin{align*}
	\left(\left(1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}\right)\dd{u}^{2} - 2\dd{r}\right)\dd{u} = 0,
\end{align*}
with solutions $\dd{u} = 0$ and $\dv{u}{r} = \frac{2}{1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}}$. The first case is as discussed above. The second has $\dv{u}{r} > 0$ for $r < R_{\text{S}}$, meaning that world lines moving towards the future are drawn to the singularity at the origin when within the Schwarzschild radius.

To describe space-like world lines, we can use Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates
\begin{align*}
	U = \abs{\frac{r}{R_{\text{S}}} - 1}^{\frac{1}{2}}e^{\frac{r}{2R_{\text{S}}}}\sinh(\frac{t}{2R_{\text{S}}}),\ V = \abs{\frac{r}{R_{\text{S}}} - 1}^{\frac{1}{2}}e^{\frac{r}{2R_{\text{S}}}}\cosh(\frac{t}{2R_{\text{S}}}).
\end{align*}
One finds that the metric is
\begin{align*}
	\dd{s}^{2} = \frac{4R_{\text{S}}^{3}}{r}e^{-\frac{r}{R_{\text{S}}}}(\dd{U}^{2} - \dd{V}^{2}) - r^{2}\dd{\Omega}^{2}.
\end{align*}
In these coordinates geodesics are hyperbolae.

\paragraph{Symmetries and Conserved Quantities}
Assume that a spacetime has a Killing field $K$, and consider a geodesic of the spacetime with tangent $U$. Along the geodesic we then have
\begin{align*}
	\dd{\tau}g_{\mu\nu}K^{\mu}U^{\nu} = \dcov{U}{g_{\mu\nu}K^{\mu}U^{\nu}} = (\dcov{U}{g_{\mu\nu}})K^{\mu}U^{\nu} + g_{\mu\nu}\dcov{U}{K^{\mu}U^{\nu}}.
\end{align*}
As the Levi-Civita connection is metric-compatible, the former term vanishes, and we are left with
\begin{align*}
	\dd{\tau}g_{\mu\nu}K^{\mu}U^{\nu} = g_{\mu\nu}U^{\nu}\dcov{U}{K^{\mu}} + g_{\mu\nu}K^{\mu}\dcov{U}{U^{\nu}}.
\end{align*}
As the path is a geodesic, the latter term vanishes and all that is left is
\begin{align*}
	\dd{\tau}g_{\mu\nu}K^{\mu}U^{\nu} = g_{\mu\nu}U^{\nu}\dcov{U}{K^{\mu}} = g_{\mu\nu}U^{\nu}U^{\sigma}\dcov{\sigma}{K^{\mu}} = U^{\nu}U^{\sigma}\dcov{\sigma}{K_{\nu}}.
\end{align*}
The two first factors are symmetric under permutation of indices, whereas the latter is not, hence this is just $0$. Thus the quantity $g_{\mu\nu}K^{\mu}U^{\nu}$ is a constant of motion along the path.

\paragraph{Symmetries of the Schwarzschild Solution}
We note that $\del{t}{}$ and $\del{\phi}{}$ are both Killing fields of the Schwarzschild solution. For $r > R_{\text{S}}$ one find that $\del{t}{}$ is time-like.

For a general path we define
\begin{align*}
	\sqrt{2E} &= g(\del{t}{}, \dot{\gamma}) = \left(1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}\right)\dot{t}, \\
	L         &= g(\del{\phi}{}, \dot{\gamma}) = r^{s}\sin[2](\theta)\dot{\phi}, \\
	\alpha    &= g(\dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma}).
\end{align*}
The latter is $1$ for a time-like path and $0$ for a light-like path. By definition we have
\begin{align*}
	\alpha &= \left(1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}\right)\dot{t}^{2} - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}}\dot{r}^{2} - r^{2}\sin[2](\theta)\dot{\phi}^{2} = \frac{2E}{1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}} - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}}\dot{r}^{2} - \frac{L^{2}}{r^{2}},
\end{align*}
which may be written as
\begin{align*}
	E - \frac{1}{2}\dot{r}^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha + \frac{L^{2}}{r^{2}}\right)\left(1 - \frac{R_{\text{S}}}{r}\right).
\end{align*}
This looks like the relation describing the potential energy of a particle in classical mechanics.
