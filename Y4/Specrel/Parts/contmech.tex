\section{Continuum Mechanics}

\paragraph{The Energy-Momentum Tensor}
In general we define the energy-momentum tensor of a continuum such that
\begin{align*}
	K^{\mu} = \del{\mu}{T^{\mu\nu}}.
\end{align*}
It will look similar to the electromagnetic energy tensor, but notably its energy density is given by $T^{00} = c^{2}\rho$.

It turns out that the spatial integral of the quantity $T^{\mu 0}$ transforms like a $4$-vector, and the quantity itself has the interpretation of momentum density.
