\section{Basic Concepts}

\paragraph{Phase Transitions}
Landau introduced the concept that phase transitions are defined by spontaneous symmetry breaking.

\paragraph{Order Parameters}
An order parameter describes spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is zero in one phase and non-zero in another.

\paragraph{Density Matrices}
The probability distribution is of the form
\begin{align*}
	p_{n} = \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{m}P_{m}}P_{n} = \frac{1}{Z}P_{n},
\end{align*}
where the summation is performed over some set of states. We now introduce the density matrix
\begin{align*}
	\rho = \frac{1}{Z}\sum\limits_{n}P_{n}\op{n}{n},
\end{align*}
yielding
\begin{align*}
	\expval{O} = \sum\limits_{n}p_{n}O_{nn} = \sum\limits_{n}\frac{1}{Z}P_{n}\expval{O}{n} = \frac{1}{Z}\sum\limits_{n}\sum\limits_{m}P_{n}\braket{n}{m}\mel{m}{O}{n} = \frac{1}{Z}\sum\limits_{n}\sum\limits_{m}\mel{n}{\rho}{m}\mel{m}{O}{n} = \tr(O\rho).
\end{align*}

As a side note, $\rho$ takes the form
\begin{align*}
	\rho = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta K},
\end{align*}
where $K$ is the Hamiltonian in the canonical ensemble and $H - \mu N$ in the grand canonical ensemble. In these cases, the partition function $Z$ may be computed according to
\begin{align*}
	Z = \sum\limits_{m}P_{m} = \sum\limits_{m}e^{-\beta K_{m}} = \sum\limits_{m}\mel{m}{e^{-\beta K}}{m} = \tr(e^{-\beta K}).
\end{align*}

\paragraph{The Ising Model}
The Ising model is a simple model of magnets. In this model, a magnet is a collection of interacting spins on a lattice under the influence of an external field. Its generalized coordinates are $\sigma_{i}$, which may take the values $\pm 1$, signifying a particular spin pointing up or down. The Hamiltonian is
\begin{align*}
	\ham = -J\sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j = \text{nn}(i)}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j} - h\sum\limits_{i}\sigma_{i}.
\end{align*}
The inner summation is carried out over the nearest neighbours of site $i$ in the Ising model, but is generally a sum over the whole lattice. The order parameter defining its phase transition is $m = \expval{\sigma_{i}}$.

This model will be used to demonstrate core concepts in the course.
