\section{Basic Concepts}

\paragraph{Phase Transitions}
Landau introduced the concept that phase transitions are defined by spontaneous symmetry breaking.

\paragraph{Order Parameters}
An order parameter describes spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is zero in one phase and non-zero in another.

\paragraph{The Ising Model}
The Ising model is a simple model of magnets. In this model, a magnet is a collection of spins on a lattice. Its generalized coordinates are $\sigma_{i}$, which may take the values $\pm 1$, signifying a particular spin pointing up or down. The Hamiltonian is
\begin{align*}
	\ham = -J\sum\limits_{i, j}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}.
\end{align*}
The order parameter defining its phase transition is $m = \expval{\sigma_{i}}$.
