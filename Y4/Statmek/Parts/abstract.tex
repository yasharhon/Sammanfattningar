This is a summary of SI2510 Statistical Mechanics.

Someone should probably give a brief statement about what this course is about. My attempt is the following: In the first course we only studied ideal systems in order to develop the machinery. Ideal systems generally have no phase transitions (bosonic gases being the exception, but quantum systems are a whole other can of worms). Having developed the machinery for describing ideal systems, we now wish to extend our studies to systems with interactions in order to describe phase transitions. This can generally not be done analytically as we have previously done, hence this course is dedicated to developing both a better language to understand phase transitions and approximate analytical methods.
