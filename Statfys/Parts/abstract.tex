This is a summary of SI1161 Statistical Physics. It contains relatively in-depth discussions of the relevant theory. At certain points the discussions are more involved than those found in the book and covered in the lectures. I would of course argue that the theory displayed in this text is appropriate for an bachelor-level physics student, but at certain points the discussion is beyond the scope of this particular course. In these cases, please refer to the course literature for a more appropriate discussions and read this text if you feel that you need or want a more in-depth discussion.
