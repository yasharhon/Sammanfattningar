\paragraph{Stirling's Formula}
In the limit of large $n$, Stirling's formula gives
\begin{align*}
	\ln{n!}\approx n\ln{n} - n.
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Exact Differentials}
The differential of a quantity $f$ on a phase space described by the vector $\vb{r}$ is an exact differential if
\begin{align*}
	\dd{f} = \grad{f}\cdot\vb{r}.
\end{align*}
The implication is that $f$ is a function on phase space, which is not true for all quantities.
