\paragraph{Combinations and permutations}
Permutations are sequences of some kind. Combinations are permutations where order does not matter. From a collection of $n$ elements, the number of possible permutations of $k$ elements is
\begin{align*}
	\Omega = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}
\end{align*}
and the number of possible combinations is
\begin{align*}
	\Omega = \binom{n}{k}.
\end{align*}
