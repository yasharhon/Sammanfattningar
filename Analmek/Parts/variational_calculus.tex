\section{Variational Calculus}

\paragraph{The objective of variational calculus}
In variational calculus, we study the optimization of functionals, typically integrals, which are maps from functions to scalars.

\paragraph{Formulating the problem}
We will primarily be interested in the following problem, as well as its derivatives:

Consider a function $q$ which assumes fixed values at $a$ and $b$ and the functional
\begin{align*}
	S\left(q, \dv{q}{\tau}\right) = \integ{a}{b}{\tau}{F\left(q, \dv{q}{\tau}\right)}.
\end{align*}
Describe the function $q$ such that $S$ has an extremum.

What derivatives of this are interesting? For instance, functionals that depend on higher derivatives and functionals based on multiple integrals, which generalize from this problem. But problems with different boundary conditions in $q$, entirely without boundary conditions in $q$ or even with a functional as a boundary condition.
