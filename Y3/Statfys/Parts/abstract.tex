This is a summary of SI1161 Statistical Physics. It contains relatively in-depth discussions of the relevant theory.

At certain points the discussions are more involved than those found in the book and covered in the lectures. I would of course argue that the theory displayed in this text is appropriate for an bachelor-level physics student, but at certain points the discussion is beyond the scope of this particular course. In these cases, please refer to the course literature for a more appropriate discussions and read this text if you feel that you need or want a more in-depth discussion.

Some of the theory is also taken from the follow-up course SI2510 Statistical Mechanics. These parts are more in-depth and rigorous discussions of theory that was covered in the basic course, so I felt like putting it here, rather than creating two discussions of the same topics with different quality. Be generous to yourself when reading this - don't spend too much time on something you might not perceive as relevant for the basic course.
